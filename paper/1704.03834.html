abstract = {MicroRNA (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that regulates the gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Determining whether a sequence segment is miRNA is experimentally challenging. Also, experimental results are sensitive to the experimental environment. These limitations inspire the development of computational methods for predicting the miRNAs. We propose a deep learning based classification model, called DP-miRNA, for predicting precursor miRNA sequence that contains the miRNA sequence. The feature set based Restricted Boltzmann Machine method, which we call DP-miRNA, uses 58 features that are categorized into four groups: sequence features, folding measures, stem-loop features and statistical feature. We evaluate the performance of the DP-miRNA on eleven twelve data sets of varying species, including the human. The deep neural network based classification outperformed support vector machine, neural network, naive Baye's classifiers, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, and a hybrid system combining support vector machine and genetic algorithm.},
